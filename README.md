# Public information

> [`NL-GRN-EDA-TEST`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST) is the test environment of the [`NL-GRN-EDA`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA) organization.

[`Public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repositories are accessible to the world, so in principle *only* this [`.github`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repository should be [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github).
This [`.github`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repository should be used to tell the world about the `Elastic Data Analytics` organization. 
- Only up-to-date information classified as [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) should be shared in [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repositories. 
- Information classified as [`internal`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/internal) or [`confidential`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/common) should *not* be shared in [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repositories.
- Information classified as `secret` should *never* be shared via GitHub.

In case multiple [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repositories are needed: all other [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repositories should be named [`public[-*]`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github).

Nearly all repositories maintained by this organization are [`private`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/common) to keep all customer-related information confidential.
These [`private`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/common) repositories are only accessible through GitHub Team assignments (just being an organization member is not enough).

> As this is the test environent, *this* repository is only used to describe how to use a [`public`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA-TEST/.github) repository in the [`NL-GRN-EDA`](https://github.com/NL-GRN-EDA) organization.
